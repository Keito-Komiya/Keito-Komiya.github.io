    <p>In clashroyale there are clans which anyone can join. From joinig that group, you can get cards level u and will be easier to win in the game and also get rewards from doing clan wars. This is a battle which the clan members battle against other clans and the more ypur members win the better chest you can get for a good rewards.</p>
    <h1>Trading</h1>
    <p>In trading cards you can request cards you want and people can give you cards and help you. Which this system makes it easier for player to win the battle.</p>
    <h1>Friendly Battles</h1>
    <p>There are a lot of fun modes in clash royale that you can use to play with fellow clanmates. There is a 1v1 function between the two of you and 2v2s where you battle between 4 people and sometimes, there's special events with unique types of friendly battles per mode such as double elexir, triple elexir, touchdown, draft, triple draft, etc.</p>
    <h1>Clan Wars</h1>
    <p>In clanwars, you participate and battle 3 times to collect the cards and after that you go to the real battle and play 1 match against other clans. The rule of the clanwars is that its fair for every other clans that we all have the same amount of attack and  4 clans battle against trying to get the most wins. 1st place, you can get 100+ number of attacking wins, 2nd- 50+numnber of win clan, 3rd- -25, 4th- -50 trophy and the worst 5 th- -100. In addition the better place you end up, the better chest you could get so its definantly better to join clans unless you have all the <a href=fourthpage.html>cards level max</a>.</p>
